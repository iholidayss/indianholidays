This tiny hillock is said to defy gravity as it tends to pull vehicles upwards. It is quite thrilling to defy the laws of science and be pulled in the opposite direction. The scientific theory states that there is a strong magnetic force emanating from the hills that defies gravity at this particular spot. It is a good pitstop on the highway and serves as a break in between mundane road travel. Do note that it is best to visit between May to September, when the road is easily accessible. There is a board that marks the location of magnetic hill, so it cannot be missed while driving down the highway.
